# Taskiem
### Simple way to create, estimate and manage product / project backlog.

## Motivation
Every time I started a new product, project, or program I faced the same dilemma: I had everything (well... almost) in my head and I needed a tool that would let me work on the spec and the project plan at the same time.  

- text editors are great for describing features but useless for project management
- spreadsheets are great for estimating time, costs, risks, etc., but not so convenient for describing features... 
- project management tools... don't even get me started...  

I decided to create the toolâ€¦ just for me.

## Usage
java -jar taskiem.jar (java 17 required)


## How it works

- Manage backlog items (almost) as easy as using text documents. 
- Estimate the time, get to the burndown, and the project finish. 
- Group backlog items "from different perspectives" or get the Gantt chart. 
- Convert documents, ie Google Docs to tasks and push them to your task management tool.
- Instant time and cost estimates without the hassle of project management tools.
- Select one of the three views: tree, grid, or board.
- Customize visible properties, size, colors, and more.
- Do not be tied to one and only tool. Ultrasimple import/export to CSV, markdown, or document.
- And more ...

## Techstack
- Java 17
- Spring Boot
- Vaadin
- h2database

## Issues / Bugs
Yes, probably many.

## Security concerns
* No, it is not a malware.
* It has not been tested extensively.

## Roadmap
* Resources rules: create team members along with their availability, velocity and cost. Auto assign rules.
* Burndown analysis.
* Multiuser. 
* Remote estimation: ask team members (separately) to estimate tasks... offline simulation of planing poker or Whiteband delphi.
